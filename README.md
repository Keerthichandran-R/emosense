# EmoSense 🌿 | Emotion-Aware AI for Human-Centered Conversations

EmoSense is a compassionate AI system designed to sense, classify, and gently respond to human emotions in text. It bridges the gap between emotional intelligence and artificial intelligence—aligning with ethical, empathetic, and human-first machine learning design.
